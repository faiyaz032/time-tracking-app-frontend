# Time Tracking App

Welcome to the Time Tracking App! This React application helps you manage and track your time effectively.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to clone the repository and run the app on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js: [Download and Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

> NB: I've used yarn for this project if you want to use npm just delete the **yarn.lock** file and run following commands with npm

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/faiyaz032/time-tracking-app-frontend.git
```

### Navigate to the project:

```bash
cd time-tracking-app-frontend
```

### Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

If you face difficulties installing the dependencies use the following command:

```bash
npm install --force
```

Or

```bash
yarn
```

> Make sure to start the **server** first before starting the application

### Start the app:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or

```bash
yarn dev
```

Now you can register and use the time tracker.

> NB: I've exposed the **env** file for testing purpose as this as a assignment.
